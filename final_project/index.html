                        <p> In 2012, Laura HillenBrand's "Unbroken" and political commenter Bill O'Reilly's "Killing Lincoln" continued their dominate march on the list in 2012, while JD Vance's "Hillbilly Elegy" started to gain momentum in 2016. 
                            In a rare feat, Bill O'Reilly - who produced about a book a year during the early 2000s - claimed both the number one and two spots on the list at the end of 2012, likely reflecting . <br> <br> In lead up to the elections in both years, right-wing politilcal commenter Dinesh D'Souza releases "Obama's America" and "Hillary's America," 
                            arguing that President Obama is the "architecht of American decline" and warning of "disaster" if Hillary Clinton is elected. Political strategists Dick Morris and Eileen McGann also offer a game plan to defeat Clinton in their top-selling book "Armageddon". 
                            In general, these  are short-lived and are replaced by books covering a diverse breadth of topics - from race to singer autobiographies."     </p>
